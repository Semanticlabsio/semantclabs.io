intro_one_header: Industry
intro_one_desc: Semantic technologies have been around for decades, widespread interest in such technologies is now becoming more evident. The application of Semantic technologies make the constant refinement of Google search results, and the Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities of IBM Watson possible, and have been behind many more impressive technological advancements of our time. Such technologies hold the key to the future of Artificial Intelligence (AI) because these technologies allow us to add knowledge and logic to AI and unlock previously unimaginable reasoning capability.
intro_two_header: Volentix
intro_two_desc: The Volentix decentralized management protocol permits the development, operation and evolution of a Dapp without requiring a company structure. Autonomous agents operate and evolve the Dapp by playing worker roles and completing work units, and can join or leave the network at any time. Knowledge is integrated using dialogue maps and managed as reusable topic-based chunks. Liquid democracy enables fluid, non-centralized control over and evolution of the Dapp by its most knowledgeable participants.
